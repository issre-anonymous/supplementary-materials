# Supplementary Materials for ISSRE Submission

## Exhaustive set: 
The full set of results for the exhaustive trials using the parameters of model A. 
The units for the measurements are as follows: 
Distance: m
Max Altitude Difference: m
Average Speed: km/h
Max Speed: km/h
Max Speed Horizontal: km/h
Max Speed Up: km/h
Max Speed Down: km/h
Max Tilt Angle: deg

## One-way data: 
The full set of results for the nonadaptive and adaptive one-way data used in Table 2. 
The units for the measurements are as follows: 
Distance: m
Max Altitude Difference: m
Average Speed: km/h
Max Speed: km/h
Max Speed Horizontal: km/h
Max Speed Up: km/h
Max Speed Down: km/h
Max Tilt Angle: deg

## Pairwise data: 
The pairwise sample sheet is the 2-way covering array used for the pairwise experiments. 
The pairwise nonadaptive and adaptive data sheets contain the full set of data for the experiments presented in Table 3. 
The units for the measurements are as follows: 
Distance: m
Max Altitude Difference: m
Average Speed: km/h
Max Speed: km/h
Max Speed Horizontal: km/h
Max Speed Up: km/h
Max Speed Down: km/h
Max Tilt Angle: deg

## Box Plots: 
The max tilt box plot sheets are the full set of results used to create the box plots depicting the maximum tilt angle for passed and failed cases in Figure 2. The max tilt angle is measured in degrees. 
The one-way nonadaptive and adaptive box plot sheets include the data for the box plots in Figure 5 and the one-way box plots in Figure 6. 
The pairwise nonadaptive and adaptive box plot sheets contain the data used to create the 2-way box plots in Figure 6 and Figure 7. 
The units for the measurements are as follows:
Distance: m
Distance from Default: m
Max Tilt Angle: deg

## Sample Logs: 
A sample set of ulog files exhibiting the types of behavior shown in Figure 3, as well as images of the flight paths for each log. These logs can be viewed using the [PX4 Flight Review software](https://review.px4.io/upload).
